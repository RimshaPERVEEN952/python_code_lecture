🖥️ Just Built a Multiplication Table in Python! ✨



I’ve been working on a small project where I wrote Python code to generate a multiplication table. It was a great exercise in loops and user input, and it feels amazing to see the code come to life! 🔢



🔹 Key takeaway: Understanding how loops can simplify repetitive tasks in coding.  



Excited to keep learning and building more projects like this! 🚀
